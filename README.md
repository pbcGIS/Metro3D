# Metro3D: Simple City Model Schema
A scheme for organizing a 3D city model designed to facilitate collaboration among:

<ul>
  <li>Municipal and campus IT organizations (geographic information systems
  <li>Design and Development community (Computer Aided Design / BIM)
  <li>Archives & Libraries, Historians, VR, Open-Source Community Apps  (Open-Source tool-chains) 
</ul>

<h2>Product: A Simple, Interoperable Archive Repository:<h2>
 This project has devised a scheme of tiling, coordinate referencing, naming and catalogging 
 to create a portable interpoerable data repository that includes
  
  <li>Detailed terrain models: SketchUp, Wavefront Object
   <li>Detailed Building Model Collection: SketchUp, ESRI Grodatabase, Wavefront Object
   <li>Model Catalog with detailed provenance and temporal information (CSV, GeoJSON) 
   <li>Groundplan images (JPG): 
      <ul>
          <li>Modern basemap, 
          <li>Recent True Ortho Photo, 
          <li>Detailed historical maps 
      </ul>
   <li>Vector groundplan and terrain linework in DXF format.

 <h2>Designed for Extension and Re-Use</h2>
 This model sharing srchitecture and the tool-kit for managnig it (coming soon to this Git repository) has been created to be re-usable and extended. We wil be posting the ArcGIS Pro toolboxes and tasks that are used toturn municipal GIS data into this repository scheme.  We also hope, to extend our project with the City of Cambridge Hostoprical Commission to develop a geographically-informed digital archive of building information (photographs and documents) -- to demonstrate how 3D models can be integrated into tools and standards used by main-stream archives, libraries and museums.

     we have developed with the sponsorship of the Boston Redevelopment Authority
