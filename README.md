# Metro3D: Simple City Model Schema
A scheme for organizing a 3D city model designed to facilitate collaboration among diverse disciplines and their tools.
<ul>
  <li>Municipal and campus IT organizations (geographic information systems
  <li>Design and Development community (Computer Aided Design / BIM)
  <li>Archives & Libraries, Historians, VR, Open-Source Community Apps  (Open-Source tool-chains) 
</ul>

<h2>Product: A Simple, Interoperable Archive Repository:</h2>
 This project provides a scheme of tiling, coordinate referencing, and cataloging 
 that produces a portable interpoerable data repository including:
  <ul>
  <li>Detailed terrain models: SketchUp, Wavefront Object
   <li>Detailed Building Model Collection: SketchUp, ESRI Grodatabase, Wavefront Object
   <li>Model Catalog with detailed provenance and temporal information (CSV, GeoJSON) 
   <li>Groundplan images (JPG): Modern basemap, Recent True Ortho Photo, Detailed historical maps 
   <li>Vector groundplan and terrain linework in DXF format.
</ul>
<h2>Designed for On-Going Management, Exchange and Historical Preservation</h2>
<p>There are many procedures and skills required to manage a city model that incorporates updates from 3D design tools and preserves historical information.  Many files are produced that one would like to keep track of.  One reason that we do not see region-wide collaborations in the development of metropolitan scale city models is that figuring out how to organize the work is very time-consuming.  This project is designed to diminish this obstacle by providing a ready-made framework.   
<p>Later this year we wil be publising the ArcGIS Pro and FME toolboxes and tasks that are used to turn municipal GIS data into this repository scheme.
<p>Next, to extend our project with the City of Cambridge Hostorical Commission to develop a geographically-informed digital archive of building information (photographs and documents) -- to demonstrate how 3D models from the Metro3D Simple City Model Scheme can be integrated into tools and standards used by main-stream archives, libraries and museums.

<h2>Designed for Extension and Re-Use</h2>
By publising these resources on GitHub, we hope to be part a city-modeling collaborative in the Boston region and in other places.    
also hope, to extend our project with the City of Cambridge Hostoprical Commission to develop a geographically-informed digital archive of building information (photographs and documents) -- to demonstrate how 3D models can be integrated into tools and standards used by main-stream archives, libraries and museums.
