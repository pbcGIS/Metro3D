<h1>Metro3D: Simple City Model Schema</h1>
<h2>Why? Expensive observations and effort are going to waste</h2>
<p>We know that in the Boston area there are several municipal governments, campus administrations and architecture firms that maintain broad-scale 3D models for their territorial interests and surrounding area.  These models are used primarily for visualizing proposed changes.  Many of these models overlap with each-other resulting in redundency of details and of effort.  Furthermore the opportunity to systematically remember the past form of the city is fragmented and impractical to collect.  
By publising these resources on GitHub and working with users we seek to answer the question: By sharing tools and data, can we eintice independent city modelers to share selected models -- tobuild a metropolitan-scale cith model that reflects current conditions and approved proposals while remembering past conditions? 
</p><p>
A culture of this sort would sustain itself because participation will be cost-effective for participants.  Additional value would be created if the resulting information was able to be captured by a variety of new applications -- including historical preservation and archiving, virtual reality, STEAM education and others.  
</p>   
<h2>What?  A scheme for organizing a 3D city model.  Facilitates collaboration among diverse disciplines and their tools.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Municipal and campus IT organizations (geographic information systems
  <li>Design and Development community (Computer Aided Design / BIM)
  <li>Archives & Libraries, Historians, VR, Open-Source Community Apps  (Open-Source tool-chains) 
</ul>
<p>
 One reason that we do not see region-wide collaborations in the development of metropolitan scale city models is that figuring out how to organize the work is very time-consuming.  The individual participants donot have the motivationth think through the needs collaborators form different disciplines. This project is designed to diminish this obstacle by providing a ready-made framework that is desiggned to preserve information through allof the potential hand-offs that are required.

<h2>Product: A Simple, Cross-Platform Archive Repository for a Module-Based City Model:</h2>
<p>A scheme of tiling, coordinate referencing, and cataloging that produces a portable interpoerable city model repository that includes:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Detailed terrain models: SketchUp, Wavefront Object
   <li>Detailed Building Model Collection: SketchUp, ESRI Geodatabase, Wavefront Object
   <li>Model Catalog with detailed provenance and temporal information (CSV, GeoJSON) 
   <li>Groundplan images (JPG): Modern basemap, Recent True Ortho Photo, Detailed historical maps 
   <li>Vector groundplan and terrain linework in DXF format.
</ul>
<p>The Archive Repository is ready now and will soon replace the prior version on the Boston Planning and Development Authority's 3D Data Download Site. You can download a fully-working demo of this simple ready-to use data package that has a built-in web-based catalog with all of the interactive-map finding aids for understanding and finding any city model components.  The repository is designed to fulfil the requirements of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">Open Archive Information System</a>. 
</p><p>
You can inspect and download a fully operational demo of this city-model scheme from this GitHub project under the Boston/ArchiveCatalog folder. 
<h2>Designed for On-Going Management, Standards-Based Asset Management, Cross-Platform Exchange and Historical Preservation</h2>
<p>There are many procedures required to manage a city model that incorporates updates from 3D design tools and preserves historical information.  Many files are produced that one would like to keep track of.  
<p>Later this year we wil be publising the ArcGIS Pro and FME toolboxes and tasks that are used to turn municipal GIS data into this repository scheme.
<p>Next, to extend our project with the City of Cambridge Hostorical Commission to develop a geographically-informed digital archive of building information (photographs and documents) -- to demonstrate how 3D models from the Metro3D Simple City Model Scheme can be integrated into tools and standards used by main-stream archives, libraries and museums.

<h2>Designed for Extension and Re-Use</h2>

<p>We also hope that this activity spawns new applications from the virtual reality, web development and open source communities.  We would love to hear from you. 
<p>Furthermore, there is no reason why this work should be limited to just the Boston Metro area!  Fork this repository and get your own metro 3D city model started!
