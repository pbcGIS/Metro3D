<h1>Metro3D: Simple City Model Schema</h1>
A scheme for organizing a 3D city model.  Facilitates collaboration among diverse disciplines and their tools.
<ul>
  <li>Municipal and campus IT organizations (geographic information systems
  <li>Design and Development community (Computer Aided Design / BIM)
  <li>Archives & Libraries, Historians, VR, Open-Source Community Apps  (Open-Source tool-chains) 
</ul>

<h2>Product: A Simple, Cross-Platform Archive Repository:</h2>
A scheme of tiling, coordinate referencing, and cataloging that produces a portable interpoerable city model repository that includes:
  <ul>
  <li>Detailed terrain models: SketchUp, Wavefront Object
   <li>Detailed Building Model Collection: SketchUp, ESRI Grodatabase, Wavefront Object
   <li>Model Catalog with detailed provenance and temporal information (CSV, GeoJSON) 
   <li>Groundplan images (JPG): Modern basemap, Recent True Ortho Photo, Detailed historical maps 
   <li>Vector groundplan and terrain linework in DXF format.
</ul>
<h2>Designed for On-Going Management, Standards-Based Asset Management, Cross-Platform Exchange and Historical Preservation</h2>
<p>There are many procedures required to manage a city model that incorporates updates from 3D design tools and preserves historical information.  Many files are produced that one would like to keep track of.  One reason that we do not see region-wide collaborations in the development of metropolitan scale city models is that figuring out how to organize the work is very time-consuming.  This project is designed to diminish this obstacle by providing a ready-made framework.   
<p>Later this year we wil be publising the ArcGIS Pro and FME toolboxes and tasks that are used to turn municipal GIS data into this repository scheme.
<p>Next, to extend our project with the City of Cambridge Hostorical Commission to develop a geographically-informed digital archive of building information (photographs and documents) -- to demonstrate how 3D models from the Metro3D Simple City Model Scheme can be integrated into tools and standards used by main-stream archives, libraries and museums.

<h2>Designed for Extension and Re-Use</h2>
<p>We know that in the Boston area there are several municipal governments, campus administrations and architecture firms that all maintain their own paralell prepresentations of themselves.  Becuase these models are all about context, there is much overlap redundency of detail and effort.  Furthermore the opportunity tosystematically remember the past formothe city is fragmented and impractical to collect.  
By publising these resources on GitHub, we hope to be part a city-modeling collaborative in the Boston region that demonstrates how sharing models will be cost-effective and synergistic.
</p>
<p>We also hope that this activity spawns new applications from the virtual reality, web development and open source communities.  We would love to hear from you. 
<p>Furthermore, there is no reason why this work should be limited to just the Boston Metro area!  Fork this repository and get your own metro 3D city model started!
